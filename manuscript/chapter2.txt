# Chapter Two

Writing in plain text is easy! You can learn most of what you need to know with just a few examples.

To see just how easy it is, open the "chapter2.txt" file in your book's "manuscript" folder. The "chapter2.txt" file is the file that this chapter is generated from!

To start a new paragraph, hit the "return" or "enter" key twice. You want to create a blank line between paragraphs.

To italicize a word or a phrase, *surround the word or phrase in single asterisks*: * *.

To make a word or phrase appear in bold, **surround the word or phrase in double asterisks**: ** **.

You can add web links to Leanpub books. Here is a link to the [Leanpub homepage](https://leanpub.com).

If you open the "chapter2.txt" file in your book's "manuscript" folder, you will see that the link was typed like this: `[Leanpub homepage](https://leanpub.com)`.

When you are creating a link, the part between the square brackets [ ] contains the words that people will see in your book, and the part in the parentheses ( ) is the web address you want to link to.

You can add an image to your book in a similar way.

First, add the image to the "resources" folder for your book. You will find the "resources" folder in your book's "manuscript" folder.

If you look in your book's "resources" folder right now, you will see that there is an image there with the file name "palm-trees.jpg".

To add the image to your book, **on a line by itself,** type an exclamation point ! to indicate that you are adding an image. Then, type the image caption between square brackets [ ]. Next, between parentheses ( ), you type the file name.

To add the image, you would type the following, on a line by itself: `![Palm Trees](palm-trees.jpg)`.

We typed the same thing in this chapter file. Here is the image:

## How Book.txt Works

If you look in your book's "manuscript" folder, you will see there is a file called "Book.txt".

The "Book.txt" file is what our book generators use to decide what other files to include in your book. It is a list of the files in your "manuscript" folder that you decide you want to include in your book.

If you open the "Book.txt" file now, you will see the following list:

chapter1.txt
chapter2.txt
chapter3.docx
chapter4.docx

If you want to write in plain text, you should delete the following lines in the "Book.txt" file, and save the change:

chapter3.docx
chapter4.docx

(Those files are for people who want to write in Word, not in plain text.)

Now, the only two lines listed in the "Book.txt" file will be:

chapter1.txt
chapter2.txt

The next time you create generate a preview of your book, our book generators will only use the "chapter1.txt" and the "chapter2.txt" files, because they are the only files listed in the "Book.txt" file. Our book generators will ignore any files in your "manuscript" folder that are not listed in the "Book.txt" file, even if those other files are still in the "manuscript" folder.

## Creating a Preview of Your Book

You can generate a new version of your book any time by going to the "Preview" page for your book on Leanpub.
